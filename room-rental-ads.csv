"MOVE-IN SEPT 1
Two yogis hoping to find a clean and considerate roommate! We live in a lovely 2nd floor walk-up apartment on a tree-lined street in Clinton Hill, about an 8-minute walk to Fort Greene Park. We live near the Clinton-Washington G stop, and half a block away from Myrtle Ave, filled with bodegas and restaurants (for take-out or outdoor seating).

We are both working and studying from home, we both practice yoga and meditation every day and study most of the time. We leave for long walks every day and are discrete. We deeply value our peace and we keep a clean and safe environment, and hope to find someone who is seeking just that!
100% LGBQT AND BLM . we take all of the COVID-19 precautions, wearing masks and sanitizing constantly.

-**It comes furnished but we can accommodate you if you need it unfurnished **

The room comes with a Full size Beauty Rest bed, nightstand, lamp, one dresser, and one cube book shelf/storage. (please see pictures, and note that pillows/comforter are decorative). It's a very large bedroom, you can fit a large desk and a chair easily, and you have TWO windows. There is an A/C in the room for hot days! (please note that you may use the A/C at a extra cost, additional to the basic utilities costs). If you have your own furniture we can definitely work something out!!

Rent is $950 plus $50 utilities, including paper towels, toilet paper, and cleaning supplies (this includes ALL cleaning supplies, and hand soap)

You would be living with:
One 32-yr old female (she/her) yoga instructor/ grad student
One 26-yr old celibate male (he/him) yoga practitioner and VR designer and grad student
One 2-yr-old male tuxedo cat called Rain (super cute and friendly, grateful rescue cat)

No smoking please! (420 is ok, discretely!)

*About the apt*
Beautiful 2.5 br/ 1 bath. Separate kitchen. Super high ceilings! Peaceful and sunlit all day (we face East and West- sun lights up the kitchen in the morning, and the bedrooms in the afternoon).

Clinton Hill is a beautiful and safe neighborhood, very close to Manhattan (if you cycle it takes 15 minutes to cross over the Manhattan Bridge), and generally a centric spot to all Bk neighborhoods.

We hope to find someone who is working/studying and who likes cats, and preferably pescatarian/vegetarian, but will accept exceptions for the right person. If you practice yoga that would be amazing!

(No party animals please, no bringing the party home. Occasional guests, if communicated to us can be accepted, and partners are welcome, but keeping all precautions, prioritizing a safe and healthy space).


**IMP: please send us Facebook and Instagram social media link and handle to be considered!**

Please reach out if you have any questions!

Light maple wide plank hardwood floors, all new European kitchen, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertop, porcelain tile to the ceiling in the bathrooms. 3 full baths in the apartment so every room has its own bath, which makes it a very good share. The room is large enough for a queen sized bed and other furniture. High security lock system - get from the street into your apartment with 1 key. Pictured is a furnished and planted garden for tenant use with teak furniture and a lounger - this is very nice during the summer. Quiet, very clean, well-maintained building with security cameras, laundry in basement and live-in super. Number 2,3 train on 135th is 5 mins away and number 4,5,6 on 125th street is 8 mins away walking which makes it very convenient to get quickly to the east or the west side. Several supermarkets are nearby and Whole Foods is nearby. Showing evenings.

Top SOHO style artist studios – at Westchester prices:
Fellow Artists! Are Bushwick, Dumbo or Williamsburg getting expensive? Are you searching for a better, more collaborative environment? If so, welcome to YOHO, Southern Westchester’s Largest Artist Community!

Better than Brooklyn: 
An established artist community is expanding and improving, with 30 new spaces just added! Encompassing the best features experienced in similar studios here at YoHo, Southern Westchester’s Largest Artist Community, these spaces have been carefully renovated while preserving their turn-of-the-century integrity and charm. If you have always wanted to be a part of an exclusive group of artists – with a price low enough that you can afford – this is your chance! Artists no longer have to pay exorbitant monthly rates to create alongside like-minded neighbors, when they can rent their workspace just outside of the city for rents starting as low as $300 a month (*if available).

A Prime location near New York City:
Located just 20 miles north of Manhattan and easily accessible via Route 9A or Interstate 87, 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue can serve as affordable alternative to the high rents found in Manhattan. Yonkers’ high percentage of public transit commuters currently ranks 8th in the country. Access to and from Manhattan can be obtained via the Hudson Line Metro North Railroad (the Glenwood and Greystone stations are just a couple miles away), express service operated by the MTA and Bee-Line bus systems (a bus stop is located in front of the YoHo building), as well as the New York Water Taxi. 

The Studios at YOHO:
The YoHo Artist Studios have been providing inspiration for a growing number of members since 2005 and have become Westchester’s Largest Artist Community! The group of creative people occupying space at YoHo find incredible comfort and practicality in their private studios. The benefit of having a designated area to concentrate on their work is exemplified by the quality of art they are producing there. Bright light emanates from the enormous windows, and the shared corridors come alive with the various colors and forms of resident artist displays. For members entering after daylight, sufficient illumination gleams onto white walls from modern fixtures strategically installed overhead.

I am a buyer's broker and here to help you to navigate the Manhattan sales market.
There are over hundreds of studios & 1 bedroom right now on market all over Manhattan and one of them can be yours! 
Some are with extremely low maintenance, which allows you to pay less than 2K monthly - while it's harder and harder to find a decent rental under 2K anywhere in Manhattan.
And you can resell your property in the future with a profit or rent it.
Interest rate is low, prices are great, and if you have great credit history and savings what are you waiting for?
Upper East Side studios and 1 bedroom from $330K & up
Midtown East studios from 275K
Tudor City, for example, has a great collection of affordable studios every month!
Upper Manhattan 1 bedrooms from 300K & up
Downtown studios from 320K & up

"Big, beautiful bedroom (will be unfurnished upon move-in) available Oct 1 in cozy, clean 2 bedroom apartment 4 blocks from the Graham Ave L, on Jackson Street. Long term sublet. You would be sharing with me, psychotherapist/PhD student in my late 20s. Bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment allowing for lots of privacy. The building is older but have never had any issues, and there are only 2 units per floor so it is quiet and cozy. Apt is on third (top) floor of a walk-up. The bedroom has a window-A/C unit installed. Heat is controlled by a thermostat in the apt and comes through strips on the floor, so no clanking radiators. The bathroom is standard NYC, not too big but not tiny, and we do have a bathtub and good water pressure. The landlord is awesome, and we have never had any issues with bugs/mice/critters of any sort. The laundromat is half a block away and there are tons of grocery stores/restaurants/coffee shops within blocks. 

While the open bedroom is quite large, the shared space is minimal so it is important that we get along. It is important to me to maintain a calm, peaceful home and I am looking for someone who feels the same. I will be in my bedroom during the day attending remote classes (with headphones) but spend a lot of days/nights at my boyfriend's apartment. It goes without saying but I am maintaining social distance according to guidelines and safe practices outside of the apartment and would ask that you do, too. 

1 month security deposit + first month rent to move in, plus a $70 application fee to the landlord. Utilities (gas, electricity, wifi) typically run $100-$150 per month depending on heat/AC use. 

Feel free to text/e-mail with any questions. Thanks! -Sara",1

"Hey there! Looking for a lovely person to re-sign my lease with for Sept 1- this apartment is an incredible find and I'm hoping to share with another awesome roommate.

Apartment: It's in Prospect Lefferts Gardens/ Crown Heights, off Lefferts & Brooklyn Ave; it's a 15ish mins walk to Prospect Park (W00T!) Getting around is easy; it's 8 mins from the Sterling 2/5, and and 12 from the Kingston 3/4 - so a quick jet to Atlantic Barclays, and you can get to Lower Manhattan in ~35 mins / midtown in ~45. Common areas are furnished so no need to worry about that, but if you have more stuff like kitchenware, we can that figure out :) 

Amenities: Elevator, study room, rooftop, gym, TV room and laundry in the basement. The unit itself has Central AC, dishwasher, open plan common area.

Rooms: All three are the same size. Each available room has floor-to-ceiling windows, a built-in closet and can fit a queen (would recommend a full though, that's what I have). Rent for each available room is $950, and utilities are often about ~$70 per head (electric/ gas/ wifi). My room has no closet but has a balcony, so I pay $1100.

Roommates: You'd be living with me - the rooms flank mine on both sides. I'm a 29-year old gay guy. I work in marketing, enjoy nature and appreciate honesty, kindness and good vibes. Hobbies vary from kickboxing, travel and theater, to just chilling with a book (or Netflix) and a beer. Yumi also just signed the lease for one of the rooms - she's 29 too, Japanese and a masters candidate and SVA. And she's super nice and considerate.

You: Would love to live with someone who is...
- LGBTQ-friendly (queer guy preferable, but definitely not a must)
- Tidy, mature, kind, honest
- Securely making steady income to cover rent monthly (if you work outside the apartment EVEN BETTER!)
- Ideally 25 years old +
- Doesn't own pets (open to discussing a cute medium-sized dog though, love a sweet dog!)
- Is not moving with a partner (happy for you and bae, but the space won't comfortably house 4 people)

Sounds like you? Would love to hear from you! Shoot me an email/text telling me a bit about yourself (name, age, job, hobbies, approach to life, etc.). Cheers ✌️

PS: Open to discussing alternative arrangements -- e.g. month to month set up -- if the vibe is right!",0

Kitchen, bathroom, and living room are shared. 

Your room has a closet, is 85 square feet or 10 ft by 8.9 ft (which is large by NYC standards) . The window is 72 inches tall, 38 inches wide, and 14 inches deep: so you can use that additional space as well. 

I have some gym equipment in the living room that you can feel free to use, including a treadmill. Working on making it a nice Living Room/Workout Area. 

Laundry facility is in the basement. 

Everything you need is just minutes away. 

About me:

30's, gay, professional, pro health and wellness. I work in accounting and am also a musician. I get along with just about anyone I *think*; haven't had any issues there so far :). I will have been here 5 years come November. The area is safe (Haven't had any problems so far there either).

30's, gay, professional, works for state government, and has been with me for 3 years now. Quiet and keeps to himself.

LGBT and 420 friendly; just don't cloud up the place :). No cigarette smoking inside the apartment. 

If you have a pet, we can discuss.

A security deposit of $1,100 plus first months rent ($1,100) is required, to move in. You can move out anytime as long as a 30 day notice is provided; however, I do prefer someone who is willing to stay long term. 

Utilities are split three way and are usually no more than $50-80 a month. This includes wifi/internet tv, heat, hot water, gas and electricity.

"Hey folks,

Roommate moving out, so looking for someone to take over the room in a newly renovated, top-floor (11th), 2 bedroom/1bathroom apartment as soon as possible. The room has ample closet space, with even more in the rest of the apt, and it is furnished with queen-size bed, nightstand, small desk and office chair, dresser and mirror, linens and towels [if needed], pillows, and AC unit.

The room is available immediately. The sublet is on a month-to-month basis, ideally longer term. The price includes full use of common areas, appliances, and facilities, in addition to covering all utilities/household bills (gas, electric, water, and wifi internet).

The apartment is conveniently located in Stuyvesant Town, a 3-minute walk from the L Train at 1st avenue or the M15 express bus running along 1st and 2nd Avenue. It is also 10 minute walk to Union Square, and even less to the East Village, Gramercy, Flatiron, and the East Side complex (NYU Tisch/Kimmel, Bellevue, Mount Sinai, and Veterans); same goes for the NYU undergrad and grad campuses, hospital medical schools, and the Cooper Union. Williamsburg and the West Side (Chelsea/West Village), via the L Train, between 5-10 minutes away; Literally a stone's throw from everywhere and everything in the city. Stuyvesant Town itself is full of its own amenities (supermarkets, soccer/tennis/hockey/volley/basketball courts, gyms, coffeeshops, restaurants, bakeries, dry-cleaning, daycare, library, playgrounds, in-complex parking [extra], plenty of street-side parking, concierge service, farmer's market on weekends, and even a winter ice-skating rink and summer concerts), all within an enormous, beautifully landscaped, park-like, quiet setting full of green, trees, lawns, fountains, unique to Manhattan. After a year here, I am still impressed, never more so than in the spring/summer. Views of the skyline from the apartment are priceless all unto themselves.

Ideal roommate will be a student, professional, or otherwise gainfully employed individual or couple, friendly, orderly, responsible, and respectful. No pets, no smoking, and no drugs please.

I am Anastasia. I am fun, friendly, and sweet. I have normal roommate expectations. I like to go out and have a good time or stay in and binge watch netflix. Ask me anything and I will answer open and honestly :) Also just to confirm it is a one bedroom apartment with a living room that was converted into another bedroom with a still existing common hangout area. Asking very low monthly rent. Prefer any age or gender. But should be clean, honest and 420 friendly as I'm very friendly.

"$1975 September 1. Huge private room in unique Bleecker duplex (includes all utilities/wifi/maid cleaning) in the heart of Greenwich Village

Love the pictures? Read the rest, shoot me an email with a bit about yourself and why you'd like to live here.

[DETAILS - THE ROOM]

The huge room is larger than most studios at 22"" x 14"". It's on the second floor of the duplex, gets great northern light, and has sloped walls for that chalet feel. The built-in loft can accommodate a king-size mattress, and the living area in the room is larger than most Manhattan studios. We have also attic access for long-term storage. High ceilings throughout the duplex.

Rent is $1975 and includes all utilities, wifi, maid cleaning, and house supplies. Move-in requires First Month + Last Month + Security Deposit ($5925 total). Lease term is a minimum term of seven months (ending March 2020), with potential extensions. 

The room is available on September 1st. Earlier move-in is possible.

No credit checks, income checks, or guarantors needed.

[Utilities]

Our duplex comes with a full-size in-unit new washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, 100 MBps WiFi, central heat and AC (we have a Nest), electricity, water, and basic house supplies (toilet paper, soaps, cleaning supplies, trash bags, paper towels, etc). I have an excellent cleaning lady come in biweekly to deep clean the bathrooms, kitchen, and living spaces, and everyone shares the minimal regular cleaning responsibilities. All of this is included in the rent - easily the cheapest deal in the area.

[THE DEAL]

My husband and I sublet our home to like-minded people. We're looking for a long-term housemate to move into our unique seven-bedroom loft in a very central location on Bleecker, south of Washington Square Park. The living situation is akin to having a large private studio with an expansive living room and a separate kitchen for occasional use, and with great people around you. 

[THE APARTMENT]

Our extremely spacious living room comes with a ten-foot wooden dining table and homey atmosphere. The apartment was recently remodeled - comes with brand new floors, furniture, and appliances we've added. Beautiful sunlight and high ceilings throughout the entire apartment (the second floor of the duplex has a small sunroof). Full bathrooms on each floor.

Our location in Greenwich Village is a short five-minute walk to several subways [A B C D E F 1 6], with groceries (Whole Foods, Trader Joes, 24/7 Morton Williams, fruit sellers), banks, taco carts, many restaurants, and 24/7 pharmacies literally across the street. Convenient to everything, yet well insulated against street noise. Within minutes of Washington Square Park, the West Village, Soho, Noho, and a short bike ride/walk to the west side water/piers. 

[ROOMMATES]

The current set are irreverent yet respectful professionals - independent people who spend most of their time outside the house, but enjoy each other's company. We're in our late twenties/mid-thirties and work across marketing, technology, and finance. At the moment, the backgrounds are Spanish, British, Bangladeshi, Nebraskan, Canadian, and Californian (and yes, some are dual/triple).

[YOU]

We are looking for someone who is very clean, respectful, and is independent yet is courteous with others. We would like someone who wants a place to relax and unwind, and not a place to bring the party nor to start off the night. That said, it is a friendly home, and we've had wonderful dinners and gatherings here.

Articulate, witty responders get first priority. Facebook / Instagram links are helpful as well.

The room is strictly for one - if you and your significant other are with each other 24/7, or if you want to entertain regularly, this is probably not the place for you. No smokers. No pets.",1

"We have one room now available in a beautiful, two floor apartment (1800 sq. ft.) by 101st and Broadway. 

The top floor (on the 1st floor of the building) has two bedrooms, two bathrooms (one inside one of the bedrooms), a living room (with a high ceiling and huge windows), a separate dining room and a large kitchen. Downstairs has two bedrooms (including the available room), a third bathroom, a washer and dryer (just for our apartment!), and the door to our private outdoor patio area with a grill, table, and chairs. 

The available room can fit a full bed and an armoire/cabinet and it has a closet. Our current roommate is willing to sell her bed and furniture to anyone taking the room (bed, bed frame, two shelving units, and rug all purchased in the last year). Move in date is flexible.

As for what we're looking for in a potential roommate: very easy going, tidy, responsible, friendly and financially secure. This apartment has been a relaxing home where we’re all friends and occasionally host low-key parties/game-nights when there are not pandemics (especially on the patio during warmer weather). The three roommates, low to mid-30s age-wise, are: a guy working in law, a woman working in the fashion world, and a woman working as a teacher. 

The new roommate would transfer onto the lease and ideally rejoin when it renews on February 1st. We are also open to the right dog, if they are small, chill and hypoallergenic. 

If you’re interested, let us know a little bit about yourself and we’ll get in touch. Thanks!",

All the rooms on the floor are occupied by music producers. The room I am offering you is #3. You will have a key to the room and 24/7 access. It is spacious at 300 sq ft, with insulated walls within the studio as well as cloth/wood sound buffers in the room as well. (Looks great, performs well). The temperature of your room is controlled with a remote control to a super-quiet A/C & heat unit near the ceiling. Works fast, works good. The room is carpeted. Each room is isolated from every other room, giving you the ultimate in a no-unwanted-noise recording.

With your room, you can access to an amazing sound booth with video camera access. All the rooms are wired to work together. 

There is a service elevator to bring your large equipment and shipments up in.

The floor itself is less than 1 year old so everything is brand new.

If I haven't used the industry lingo in this post, it is simply because I am a violin teacher. I used the space for violin lessons and retail sales, and I can no longer host group violin classes in this space like I used to, so I am calling it a day on group classes and am looking for someone to take over my lease. 

The owner is offering a very good deal for the room at $2850 (lowered because of COVID). 

Call or email ASAP if interested. Available immediately. Looking to fill for August. Pro-rate for partial month ok. This is a great deal, so don't wait if interested.",1

"I feel incredibly lucky to call this place my home... Come join me!

Our apartment is a 3-bedroom on the second floor of a house with a separate entrance, a spacious/bright kitchen and living room, and a large balcony surrounded by trees and gardens. Situated on a quiet street, we're a 30-second walk from Cortelyou Rd, complete with organic food marts, restaurants and stores, and a six-minute walk from the Cortelyou Road Q station (20 minute train ride to Canal Street and 25 minutes to midtown).

I am female, age 41, originally from Brooklyn, and currently work as the principal of a Jewish after-school. I have a background in theater, dance (anyone also doing Gaga dance every day?), public radio and arts producing, and just bought a mandolin...though I'm not sure I have any musical talent. I love this apartment. It's warm and cozy, the landlord and his family live downstairs (and sometimes cook incredible meals for us), it has access to a large, gorgeous porch...I've lived in a bunch of places and this one's my favorite by far. I've been living here for the last 3 years and love this place. 

Unfortunately, both my roommates had to move out recently (one returned to Europe to care for her grandmother during COVID, and the other moved in with his best friend, who recently moved to NYC). I just filled one of the rooms with a lovely, friendly woman and am looking for a warm, friendly, respectful professional to share our home. I'm ideally looking for folks to stay long term (6 months or longer), but we can discuss shorter terms if needed.

Room available:
Faces a beautiful backyard and vegetable garden
Sunny
2 closets (1 standard size and 1 large/walk-in)
Hardwood floors

Features of the apt:
- Large extra storage room
- Big and sunny balcony
- New, large and comfortable kitchen
- Shared large living room with a dining table and sofa
- Clean and comfortable shared bathroom
- Laundromat nearby
- Terrific neighborhood
- Landlord lives downstairs and will fix anything immediately.

One month security to be paid in advance to the landlord.

- no smoking
- no pets per landlord policy (his children have allergies)
- Approx $50-$60 utilities/month (internet, gas, electric)

I'm looking to fill this room as soon as possible and will be holding zoom interviews to start. We'll also discuss COVID precautions to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable during this time. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!",

"Experience this unique Southern Vermont property in an exceptionally beautiful setting.
The house was built in 1988 originally for two people. It could support a family of four at it's maximum without any change to the infrastructure. The house sits half a mile off the road on a mountain side. The first quarter mile is on a flat ROW gravel driveway, the second quarter mile is a steep gravel driveway to the top. There is room to park two cars right in front of the house.

Mountain views to the south, hiking trails among the trees throughout the 26 acres. 
House, garden, barn and outhouse sit on approx one acre. Garden is currently 30x40 with room to expand below and possibility to create a terraced garden above. This could be used as a small homestead farm with small animals (chickens, goats), increased vegetable production and potential for foraging or growing crops in the woods.

There are many trails among the remaining 25+ acres which include a combination of Ash, White Pine, Sugar Maple, Oak, Hickory, Beech and a variety of nut trees.


There is a 1000 gallon propane tank buried underground (in case you need to heat with hot water baseboard), I have always used the wood stove in the winter and never needed more than 3 1/2 Cord of wood over the winter.
The roof is asphalt shingle which has reached the end of its life. The roof does not leak but will require replacement at some point in the near future.

If you enjoy wildlife there is an abundance including, Hawks, Owls, Deer, Bats, Red Fox, Squirrel, Chipmunk and a mountain behind the property that is home to a protected Peregrine Falcon Nest site.
There are also an abundance of deer although they usually disappear during hunting season.
Winter snowshoeing and cross country skiing and a variety of wild life make this property a fun place to live.
Property is surrounded by nature conservancy land.

Cherry floors and Maple kitchen cabinets on the first floor with cherry stairs to the second floor. Maple floor boards upstairs. Interior doors are cedar. 
Wood stove has been used as a primary heat source but Propane baseboard heating is also available.
 
New propane wall hung boiler installed November 2019, new batteries installed November 2019. 
New Solar Panels and charge controllers installed November 2015. 
The house is south facing getting plenty of sun and windows provide excellent light within the house. 

House is situated between two major ski areas, Killington in Rutland and Stratton in Manchester and only 3 1/2 hours drive to Montreal.

New driveway installed 2017 as well as new fiber optic cable bringing high speed internet, internet TV and internet phone service. 

Appliances that come with the property include woodstove, propane refrigerator, new propane oven, gas generator and all the solar utility equipment. Optional are propane dryer and washing machine.
For more photos please contact the seller.
Currently the home is occupied by tenant who is in the process of moving out. If you would like an appointment to view inside the home it can be arranged.",1

"Large sunny room in a bright apartment one block away from the park. 

Upfront disclaimers… #1) this is my apartment (I’m not the roommate…I care about renting to quality humans because while I’m not living with you, we have to interact with each other throughout the year! There’s no fee of any kind (other than standard security deposit after signing).

About you… The type of roommates/tenants we are looking for are those who tow a lovely line between being sociable, respecting privacy and having a life outside of the apartment. People from all walks of life, genders and sexualities are welcome to apply but please be a decent human who enjoys living in a (super!) clean space and is respectful of everyone. You will meet the existing roommates… both lovely ladies and you would be more than welcome to facetime/meet them in person before signing to make sure it’s a good fit for you. 

About the room…easily fits a full or queen size bed with room for desk and dresser and other items. The room comes furnished with everything in the pic and has a closet…we can also move it out. 

About the apartment…it’s a large 4-bed/1-bath. There are only two apartments per floor, so the apartment takes up half the building and runs the length from the front to the back of the building.

About the building...quiet with only 8 apartments and also secure (video cams at the front and back of the building.

About the neighborhood...Crown Heights. Park Place is a beautiful quiet block…it’s one block to Brower Park if you need some outdoor space (have included a pic) and also one block from everything happening on Nostrand Avenue… Super Power (try the Painkiller…just the one it’s really, really strong!) the Ryerson, Nostrand Pub, Two Saints, Sweet Bar and Grill, Colina Cuervo just to name a few. We are also three-blocks away from Franklin Avenue (which is literally all bars and restaurants). Also a 20 min walk to Prospect Park. 

About transport... two train options. The 3 and 4 line is on Eastern Parkway which is 4 blocks away and the A train at Nostrand in Bed-Stuy (express so 4-stops to Manhattan) and is 6 blocks away. Access to numerous bus lines (1-3 blocks from the apt).

Requirements…In terms of requirements, we will need a security deposit (only after signing) and also documents to demonstrate you have a stable rental history and/or documents (paystubs/stipends/savings account) to show you’re responsible and will honor your rental agreement. Sorry, no couples.",1

"One bedroom still available in spacious 4-bedroom pre-war apartment on historic brownstone lined block…5 minutes walk from Nostrand A/C line in Crown Heights (4-stops to Manhattan). 

Upfront disclaimers… #1) this is my apartment (I’m not the roommate…I also live in the building and care about living with quality humans…also there’s no fee of any kind (other than standard security deposit after signing). #2) we just finished renovating the apartment this week - the pictures posted are a compilation of the renovated apt and another apt with the same layout. I have included these because it’s really difficult to determine room size/layout from pictures of rooms without furniture. 

About the apartment/building… The building was built in 1906 and is classic pre-war style with 13ft high ceilings and 6ft high windows. The apartment has a renovated kitchen, bathroom, light fixtures, pickled white oak floors throughout, however has been very well cared for and maintains many of the original architectural details, including a vaulted living room ceiling, intricate plaster wall moldings and shelves. The building has also never been subdivided into smaller apartments…as you can see from the pictures the apartment is absolutely huge with the added bonus of having the original plaster and lathe walls (this means you rarely hear your next door neighbors…or roommates in the apartment for that matter). The kitchen has been updated with white hardwood cabinetry, granite counters, matte black hardware and terrazzo style floors with a cute dining nook. The bathroom has also been renovated and features classical white subway tiles with a huge arched mirror and matte black sconce and fixtures. 

About the street/neighborhood… We are located on a historic and architecturally significant street with three beautiful churches on 1 ¼ blocks! It’s beautifully quiet however we are also a two-block walk to King Tai (the cutest little cocktail bar that let’s you sit outside and order takeout). There are also many bars and restaurants one block away on Nostrand Avenue…Super Power (try the Painkiller…just the one it’s really, really strong!) the Ryerson, Nostrand Pub, Two Saints, Sweet Bar and Grill, Colina Cuervo just to name a few. We are also three-blocks away from Franklin Avenue (which is literally all bars and restaurants). If you need quiet time, we are also 3-blocks to Brower Park (I’ve included a pic from Spring) and also a 20 min walk to Prospect Park. 

About you… The type of roommates/tenants we are looking for are those who tow a lovely line between being sociable, respecting privacy and having a life outside of the apartment. People from all walks of life, genders and sexualities are welcome to apply but please be a decent human who enjoys living in a (super!) clean space and is respectful of everyone. Three roommates have already signed on…both lovely ladies and you would be more than welcome to facetime/meet them before signing to make sure it’s a good fit for you. 

Requirements
In terms of requirements, we will need a security deposit (only after signing) and also documents to demonstrate you have a stable rental history and/or documents (paystubs/stipends/savings account) to show you’re responsible and will honor your rental agreement. Sorry, no couples. 

About the rooms…

The remaining rooms is $1000.
The $1000 room is 12ft x 7.5 ft with additional 2.75 ft x 2.5 ft closet and on the fire escape. It's not the biggest room but it's totally functional - fits a full size bed and desk. 

About transport… We are a 6 minute walk to the A-train at Nostrand Avenue station. We also have a bus that drops you at the front door, as well as other bus lines one block away.",1

Stuyvesant Town itself is full of its own amenities (supermarkets, soccer/tennis/hockey/volley/basketball courts, gyms, coffeeshops, restaurants, bakeries, dry-cleaning, daycare, library, playgrounds, in-complex parking [extra], plenty of street-side parking, concierge service, farmer's market on weekends, and even a winter ice-skating rink and summer concerts), all within an enormous, beautifully landscaped, park-like, quiet setting full of green, trees, lawns, fountains, unique to Manhattan. After a year here, I am still impressed, never more so than in the spring/summer. Views of the skyline from the apartment are priceless all unto themselves.

Ideal roommate will be a student, professional, or otherwise gainfully employed individual or couple, friendly, orderly, responsible, and respectful. No pets, no smoking, and no drugs please.

"Hi! I'm looking for a new roomie for the start of August.

The room available is a furnished private room in a bright, spacious renovated 3bdr/1 bath apartment. Located on the 6th floor in an elevator building, the apartment is located half a block from the express subway stop (ABCD train) at 145th St and within easy walking distance to some of the best bars, cafes and restaurants in Harlem.

The room is moderately sized for a NYC room, with a full-size bed and large closet space. Lots of natural sunlight and is peaceful and quiet away from street noise.

The apartment has been renovated in the last 5 years - new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen with a dishwasher, the living room is sun-drenched and has an amazing view from the top of Sugar Hill looking down towards mid-town. The bathroom is small but it is clean, simple and bright.

The neighborhood is awesome! There's a beautiful community spirit in Harlem and even in the middle of Covid-19 there are so many places to explore and hang out. Riverside Park (it's a beautiful park right beside the river, with picnic areas and a bike/running track that goes all the way down to the west village) is a 5 minute walk away and there are many unique bars, cafes, restaurants etc to choose from. There's a laundromat across the street and a massive Super Food Town grocery store 3 blocks away.

You'll be sharing the apartment with myself and my roommate. I'm Australian, mid 30s, full-time musician, very tidy, yogi, plant lover and a clumsy but enthusiastic salsera. We're both fairly tidy, clean, quiet and try to be considerate of each other and our neighbors. The apartment feeling like a home with lots of good energy and respectful for each others privacy.

We have a cleaner every fortnight to do all the major cleaning (which is usually an extra $30 per person depending how much cleaning is necessary) which I've found has been the best way of having a clean home in a share situation.

$1200 per month plus cleaning costs. Internet/utilities included.
$900 security deposit.
Room available from August 1. Very sorry but no couples or pets.

Please email me if you think you can see yourself living here. I'll start meeting prospective roommates via Zoom/FaceTime and then schedule an in-person viewing after that.

"Fast description:
1) Location 14 street East bet. second and first avenues. Closer to second ave.
2) Your private room, with good heat and air conditioned, nice queen bed, we share bathroom and and kitchen, collapsing windows, all nice.
3) Bathroom door next to your room door.
4) I made the living room my room, has a sliding door.
5) First month rent, 890, (is half of the total rent) plus one month security deposit.
6) I am the only person living here, a male professional working in a stable job, now working online.
7) To have a first conversation we can have a Zoom session.
8) Please send all info about work, regular hours, etc. I had roommates for years, no problem ever.
More details below:

This is a slightly modified ad from last time, most pictures are from an old roommate, there is a fairly new queen bed) East Village-Gramercy-Union Square- 14 Street East close to Second Avenue. Peaceful back of the building, view to trees. Available now. Tell me about how I am sure that you can pay the rent and your regular hours. I do not respond to all e-mails and least of all to something like this: ""I am nice and pay my rent on time, call me"" ""when can I see the room?"" I do not need to know anything but work details, income, hours of work because this is small and late night routine work, coming back at 5 in the morning everyday, would wake me up, for example, I am a late going to sleep guy. Make an aprox. picture of your life, leaving physical details of all types out, think about yourself in my position. This is a 4th floor walk up. That said, read on...
Location, location, location... (Old New York proverb)
890 a month, it is a rent stabilized apt. I will show you the lease. Expecting six months minimum. First month rent, and one month security deposit. Shared utilities and Internet connection.
Price now is exactly half the rent.
Your nice private room on 14 Street East, back of the building, nice collapsing windows, plenty of light, wall air conditioner, closet, bathroom next door, we share kitchen and bathroom. Fresh in summer and warm in winter, very good heat. New bed in room. (The pictures are from how another ex-roommate had the room set) You can smoke in your room, I smoke in mine too; hope you open your window to do so...
I closed the living room and made it my room, very private too with a sliding door, close to the kitchen.
I am single, divorced guy, I am not looking for a girlfriend, or companionship, but I am a friendly person. I know that I am good looking, athletic, but I am a fully mature adult, not a kid.
I work for a recognizable institution in the City, I work at home now via computer. I have been a part-timer for them for years and I have other intellectual activities related to the humanities, that is why I need a roommate, I like to travel, read and write. Please tell me about your job, hours, etc, etc, etc
Kitchen with all utensils, pots and pans, good size refrigerator.
Bathroom with bathtub and good water pressure, good size, good hot water. Laundry in building.
In case you are not from NYC let me tell you this is the most sought after area of Manhattan, two blocks from Union Square, my side of 14 street East belongs to Gramercy, across the street starts the East Village, where you will find hopefully in the future thousands of cool restaurants, bars, parks and still find the coolest people on the island. This is where the fun is, or used to be, not dead boring uptown. Do not let scammers try to rent you an apartment with the title ""East Village"" and it is on 59th Street East, or Williamsburg, because you could take a train to get here...Here, no need for Uber or taxi, the fun will be right here, down the stairs. BIKE distance from many jobs in the area, NYC.
Also, as this apt is located two short blocks from Union Square, center where basically you can take one train of the many that stop there and go one shot to uptown and downtown East, up and down cross-town. Look at the map. Trains 4,5,6, W,R,Q, N. Also, cross-town buses and the L train are here 3 minutes walk.
Please imagine that you are in my situation and send all the info about yourself that would be important.
The lease is on my name. I can document all of the above and I am looking for roommate that can prove having a job and an income stable and substantial enough to pay her/his part of the rent.
I would expect the roommate to stay at least 6 months, but I can hear other options.
This is perfect for anyone currently looking for an apartment in the City, and the price is good. Be safe, I know things are difficult now...We will rebound.",1

"MOVE-IN DATE: October 1.


LENGTH OF STAY:

I am looking for a roommate for a minimum of 2 months, or 8 weeks.


THE LOCATION:

WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, off the A/C & 1 subway lines.

This is UPPER MANHATTAN (northern Manhattan) on the WEST SIDE.

The A, the C, and the 1 take you to midtown Manhattan west (59th St. / Columbus Circle) in 20 minutes, Times Square in 25 minutes.

Fantastic location for people who work or study UPTOWN (NORTHERN MANHATTAN) or on the WEST SIDE.


PRICE:

$790 + $25 gas & electricity = $815 total

Unless you use the air conditioner in your room. Then electricity would cost more.


UTILITIES & INTERNET:

Heat & hot water are included in the rent.

So is wifi.


THE ROOM:

It is a small room, 8 feet by 9 feet = 72 square feet.

Or 6.7 square meters (about 2.4 by 2.7 meters).

So best for someone who doesn’t have a lot of stuff, or who wants it short-term (less than a year – but I'm looking for someone who will stay at least 8 weeks, or 2 months).


THE APARTMENT:

It’s a 2-bedroom, so a good situation for someone who does not want to share the bathroom & common areas with 10 other people + their significant others!

I (a female) am the only other roommate.

Sunny & cute.


THE BUILDING:

We are on the 1st floor. This means that you won’t have to walk up 10 flights every time you come home!

This is a prewar building with soaring ceilings.


THE NEIGHBORHOOD:

Washington Heights is an up-and-coming neighborhood.

This building in particular is 6 blocks from Columbia University's Medical School / New York-Presbyterian Hospital.


FURNITURE:

The room comes furnished, with everything you see in the pics.

A full-sized bed, a 60-inch wide Real Simple wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a mirror, an air conditioner, a trash can, and a tiny end table.


PETS:

For those of you who have allergies, my cat died almost 2 years ago. I probably won't get another one any time soon.

Your clean, well-behaved pets are welcome!


COUPLES:

Sorry, no couples.",1

"Experience this unique Southern Vermont property in an exceptionally beautiful setting.
The house was built in 1988 originally for two people. It could support a family of four at it's maximum without any change to the infrastructure. The house sits half a mile off the road on a mountain side. The first quarter mile is on a flat ROW gravel driveway, the second quarter mile is a steep gravel driveway to the top. There is room to park two cars right in front of the house.

Mountain views to the south, hiking trails among the trees throughout the 26 acres. 
House, garden, barn and outhouse sit on approx one acre. Garden is currently 30x40 with room to expand below and possibility to create a terraced garden above. This could be used as a small homestead farm with small animals (chickens, goats), increased vegetable production and potential for foraging or growing crops in the woods.

There are many trails among the remaining 25+ acres which include a combination of Ash, White Pine, Sugar Maple, Oak, Hickory, Beech and a variety of nut trees.


There is a 1000 gallon propane tank buried underground (in case you need to heat with hot water baseboard), I have always used the wood stove in the winter and never needed more than 3 1/2 Cord of wood over the winter.
The roof is asphalt shingle which has reached the end of its life. The roof does not leak but will require replacement at some point in the near future.

If you enjoy wildlife there is an abundance including, Hawks, Owls, Deer, Bats, Red Fox, Squirrel, Chipmunk and a mountain behind the property that is home to a protected Peregrine Falcon Nest site.
There are also an abundance of deer although they usually disappear during hunting season.
Winter snowshoeing and cross country skiing and a variety of wild life make this property a fun place to live.
Property is surrounded by nature conservancy land.

Cherry floors and Maple kitchen cabinets on the first floor with cherry stairs to the second floor. Maple floor boards upstairs. Interior doors are cedar. 
Wood stove has been used as a primary heat source but Propane baseboard heating is also available.
 
New propane wall hung boiler installed November 2019, new batteries installed November 2019. 
New Solar Panels and charge controllers installed November 2015. 
The house is south facing getting plenty of sun and windows provide excellent light within the house. 

House is situated between two major ski areas, Killington in Rutland and Stratton in Manchester and only 3 1/2 hours drive to Montreal.

New driveway installed 2017 as well as new fiber optic cable bringing high speed internet, internet TV and internet phone service. 

Appliances that come with the property include woodstove, propane refrigerator, new propane oven, gas generator and all the solar utility equipment. Optional are propane dryer and washing machine.
For more photos please contact the seller.
Currently the home is occupied by tenant who is in the process of moving out. If you would like an appointment to view inside the home it can be arranged.",1

"Hi!

I have a large room (15 x 12) available in a three bedroom apartment. There are two king sized rooms and one full sized one. I'd like to have just one roommate right now, so the third room would be used as extra space. If you're working from home and would like the space to yourself, we can negotiate on the price.

The apartment is gut renovated and brand new. There's a dishwasher, microwave, video intercom, and central air (!). 

It has an open kitchen and exposed brick throughout. The room has a large closet and storage space. 4th floor walk up.

It's mostly furnished in terms of furniture and kitchen supplies, but open to more if you have them!

Located in Crown Heights where there are tons of bars and restaurants. Laundry is across the street. Steps from the President 2/5 and also walking distance from the Franklin 2/3/4/5 and Nostrand A/C. 

Looking for a Sept 1 move in, but can be flexible.

You would be a subletter through me, though you'd be required to qualify through the management company with income 40x the rent and good credit.

First month's and security (equal to first month's) would be due.

Utilities usually run about $60 each.

I'm a 30 year old woman who works as a product designer for a tech company. I'm looking for someone fairly similar in terms of age/life situation. I like to keep a clean, quiet space, and would love to find someone I can work well with while we're both at home through covid : (.",1

"Steps from Danny's Pizzeria this incredibly unique apartment is available for August 15TH. I'm posting this Wednesday and if the place is still available Monday I will be really surprised. This apartment rarely comes on the market and it never lasts long. Look at the pictures, it's enormous. This is a great place to put down roots and stay for several years, the landlord is accommodating and will allow some pets on a case by case basis. 

The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a walk-up building but with low lying buildings surrounding it, you get a great view of the neighborhood with tons of light. The main bedroom is larger than 20'x20' and the living room has 12' ceilings. The apartment is rent stabilized meaning your rent can never be raised by more than 4% per year! Apartments like these are increasingly rare. Call or text me now to set-up a showing. The current tenant will allow us in with reasonable notice. If you need a video walk-through I can try to get that as well. Thanks and good luck!

cheers,

Aaron",1

"Awesome roommate wanted for September 1st-October 1st!

Wonderful location - conveniently nestled around landmark restaurants, great cafes, markets, bars, gelato and more!

Must Love Dogs, or at least an adorable 1 year old cavalier 🙂 🐶

Beautiful apartment in the heart of Astoria, just a two minute walk to the train. Just one flight up-- and we are the only apartment in the building so no noisy neighbors! Laundry is in building, right downstairs.

We are: Two female roommates who are clean, fun, warm, and hospitable. We enjoy relaxing with a glass of wine and movie or tv show, cooking a nice meal. Happy to hang out or not hang out, and super respectful of privacy and space.

Room is more generously spacious than photos demonstrate! And SUPER SUPER SUNNY! I gave it a fresh coat of pretty light blue paint, you are welcome to paint a different color if you would like as long as it is neutral/not a dark color. 

About the apartment: Massive sunny 3 bedroom off the Ditmars stop. 2 blocks to train. Kitchen, living room and bathroom are all fully furnished. There is an abundance of space in this amazing home! All gorgeous, modern, stainless steel appliances, two skylights, full bathtub, endless light in every corner of the house, very cozy atmosphere.

The available room is generous and spacious, super quiet and extremely sunny~ It can comfortably fit a Queen bed, dresser, multiple bookshelves and more, as pictured.

Hoping to find that potential wonderful roommate with a similar work/lifestyle. Ideal candidate: drama-free, responsible adult. Works during the day, happy to socialize but does not bring the party home. We take pride in our home and seek the same in our new housemate! We keep a clean, tidy home and are looking for someone who will really integrate well with us and our home. Additionally it’s important to know that we are looking for a long-term situation.

Rotating cleaning schedule 🧹 🧼

All you need is : 1 month security deposit + 1st month's rent to move in.

If you're interested in the room & meeting us, please tell us a little bit about yourself and let us know if you'd like to coordinate and meet. We will be gladly meeting people over the next few days and look forward to hearing from you as we hope to fill the vacancy very soon.

The room is for one person only! Thank you and we look forward to meeting you!",1

"A temporary female roommate needed, it could be a student, someone doing an internship, or someone who needs a place to save some money and get something better. The ideal time of staying is 6 months. It's a studio apartment that means its all open space, no separated bedroom, except the bathroom and kitchen. I work full time, so I spend most of the time out of the home. I'm also doing my master's program online, so home is my school. I want someone that understands that. I hope to find some who is going to a similar situation. The price is $ $100 weekly with WIFI and electricity include. I hope I can find someone, take care, and be safe!
In the picture, you can see that the person will have her area. Also, there will be a room divider, to give more privacy while sleeping.",0

"Hi all,

We have a room available in our 4 bedroom apartment available for immediate move-in. One of the rooms is an office so you would have two other roommates (and two cats also live here). This would be month to month for short or long term, depending on what you'd like to do.

About the apartment:

-Located a block from the 145 A/B/C/D stop in Manhattan.
-One large shared bathroom and a shared kitchen (you would have your own shelf and place in the fridge, etc).
-6th floor unit-Elevator Building
-Washer/Dryer in building
-On site Super
-Quiet Building
-Great view (we face east)
-Utilites are shared (electricity, internet)
-Available for immediate move-in

We are two professionals in our mid 30s, and we tend to keep regular hours. We are pretty relaxed and just ask that you clean up after yourself. I'm a theatre-loving paralegal and my roommate, who holds the lease, is in real estate. You must be ok with cats - they don't destroy anything and are really nice and friendly, but if you're allergic, you might have issues. Please no other pets (sorry)!

I have lived here for two years and love it and my roommate has been here for over 5 years. We'd love to have a great roommate to join us! (Serious inquiries only, please.)

We would require 1 mo. security deposit and 1st month's rent. Available immediately - LGBTQIA friendly, and again, must be ok with cats.",1
