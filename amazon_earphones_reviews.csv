"Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

"very nice product. Sound quality is awesome. good fitting inside ear. battery backup is approx 2.5-3 hours. best piece of tech in this price range

"Really loved this product and will recommend it to everyone. The product looks fancy yet is not expensive. I opted for grey color but other two variants are equally appealing. Takes negligible time to connect with server. Sound quality is very good and those magnet provided at the back of ear plugs makes it very handy to carry. Battery life is also good plus the noise cancellation is also effective. Overall it is a good product, worth the price and one should go for it.

"The product is surprisingly good. I thought at this price the functioning Will be basic. But they have included volume keys too. Audio quality and noise cancellation is also satisfactory. But the battery backup is very low. I'm only getting around 2.5 hrs backup while using calls. Also it starts saying ""Low battery!! Please charge!!"" once the charge is below 20% repeatedly making it literally unusable

"These are excellent bluetooth earphones as expected! The sound is clear with  music , videos and phone calls. The caller can be heard very clearly as well as the caller can hear me with no disturbances. Also along with these ear - plugs are so that the chances of sliping reduces. It is best for  travelling as it is bluetooth earphones. Along with this you will be getting charging wire and main benefit is that you will be getting 1 year warranty with itüòçüòçüòç

I know, its Chinese make product with 700 bucks of price tag, but has way to go for perfection. Overall 2 star rating purely for Amazon delivery promise. Think before you buy it guys.

"I purchased from ptron headphones earlier another model. They were excellent. So purchased again from this brand. Here my initial impressions.Material used is good, decent quality and flexible.Sweat proof is ok.Noise cancellation is decent.Sound is ok but do not expect much based on price.Heavy bass not involved.Surrounding sound is goodTreble and noise levels are good but if it included with a bit base these could be more than promised for the customer.

"1) the length of the wire is a  couple of inches short2) extremely heavy on one side and keeps falling off from the ear beause of the weight.3) the buds provided with the headset are loose. The bud stays in the ear while the ear phone pops out.4) within a day of using the headset the buds fell off and got lost.  There after unable to use this product. The ear phone don't fit properly in the ear without the buds.5) the Bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.6) no warning before shutting off, because of low charge. If you are in a call, there is hardly any warning of low battery.

The music comes very clear.Third- I found this very convenient to wear it does not hurt your ears at all,plugs are very nice also they get attach to each other,  as it's sides have magnet.  So no worries.Fourth- Also it is very easy to receive calls on this by clicking the centre button and changing tracks while listing to music by long pressing + buttonLast but not the least very good battery back up.

Listen to some acoustics and bam, this will take you away on your own music studio, :P.....Bluetooth connectivity is okayish mediocre range works only with one device.Hence, as mentioned the pros doesn't justify the cons and nor the price.

"The audio quality and comfort in the ear is good. The call quality is also good. There are downside for the earphones:1. Pricey compared to the non Bluetooth version of same earphones.2. Battery should have more capacity.3. Disconnects and auto connects when idle, not sure why! Also if calls are attended via mobile when earphones are connected then Bluetooth gets disconnected permanently.4. Doesn‚Äôt have IP rating or is not sweat resistant. Be careful while playing or taking out in rain cause the water can get inside and the earphones get easily damaged!

No doubt this product seems to you very attractive and it should be at last it's Jbl product.But friends don't buy this product from amazon, this is not a genuine productAfter 28 days of purchasing this product, it started showing charging productsNo matter how much u charged it will not last for more than 5 minutes and guys amazon will not at all help you to get this product refundAnd you have to contact the jbl service center which is really very much hecticMy point of purchase is amazon but they simply denied to help me furtherPlease don't waste your money and time2000 rupees is not a small amountIt's get time to earn this money and entire money will go in to vain

If you have experienced something like Sony MDR-XB55AP, then you can't settle for this sound at this price.Verdict: Best bluetooth buds at this price. But Sony MDR-XB55AP or even Skullcandy offer much better sound at this price. So if you're an audiophile, looks elsewhere.

Noise cancellation is great, before reaching top volume your ambience will be mute doesn't matter how much noise is there... Sound quality is great in a quite place you can't listen to top volume (if you're not a hard core Metallica fan, for them no headphone has enough sound).

"this device here received a tons of negativity on Amazon and other sites but just a quick note that when we shift from wired to wireless the sound quality really affects so if we have to compare we should do it with other wireless earphones not the wired one .The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is good. Perfect for EDM lovers Electronic dance music.The connection range is amazing .It's really easy to connect to new deviceson the physical overview, it has got a really big neckband which is kind of annoying most of the times and it has 3 buttons - one to play and pause  music or receive call or end and the other two to change the music as well as to change volume, depending the time u press those keyswhen we talk about the looks of the device it looks good if you are wearing a shirt or a t-shirt with a collar so u can hide the neck ban in the collar if not then it's uncomfortable and also looks awkward at the same timeat a price point of 2000rs and jbl branding it is a fair pricetime for the big deal the pros and conspros;Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is good. The output of a fully charged device is around 6-8 hours  depending on the volumebuild quality is amazingCons:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides aboutThe magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.bass is not much as jbl devices are known for high bassThis is a great device but the wireless earphones lacks in either sound/battery/looks/comfort and this one lacks in comfort

"well i would give it (4-1)star for a reason... sound is really good and with deep basss but with a catch here. i had bought the headphones and was very disappointed for a flat bass and lots of treble sounded waste of 2k... but then i had spare ear buds of sony mdr wired earphones (spare buds) which were perfect fit on jbl ones and woah the sound felt amazing really worth the jbl sound series..... well the biggest problem is with the too hard ear buds provided with dosent give full isolation to bass effe t to shape...so people who have already bought try replacing the earbud with any old headphone you have which are useless

"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. Have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.I use Audio Technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. Bought these JBL Bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.Pros:Charge lasts about 5 hours.Lightweight.Produces very clear sound.Bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.Cons:Slightly more expensive than I'd have liked, I paid 2250...Microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating.

"One of the worst product from jbl I have ever bought. The earphone stopped working in a month. Then took them to the service centre in nehru place  where in their customer register all the complaints were related to this product only. As far as the customer care service is concerned, it is way more worse than the product because Jbl take ages to replace your product as for mine they took 20 days for the replacement. Then again the new earphones stopped working within a month.So, as a genuine user of this product I would not recommend anyone to go for these earphones as it has some manufacturing defect within the device itself.

I expected at least a repair by paying a few bucks after surpassing 1 year warranty deadline at the authorized service centre which again is just one in whole gujarat state. But to my shock they denied repairing and when I called their customer care they justified it with all silly reasons for not repairing.

"This is a decent earphone considering the sound quality, brand value and cost. Don't expect thumping bass response from its 8.6 mm driver, the sound is not flat or full though. Give it some time to burn in the speaker to get the real sound of it. The call quality is horrible with this , you just can't roam around the rooms and talk, also the mic position is problematic. The build quality is average and is made of plastic, the wire is tangle free and of good quality. My first set have one of its speaker casing fall out of place, so have to order a replacement.
